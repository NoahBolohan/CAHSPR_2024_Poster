# Background & Motivation

Canada has seen an increasing number of opioid-related harms and deaths between January 2016 and June 2023, with an estimated:

+ 39,435 opioid-related hospitalizations
+ 40,462 apparent opioid toxicity deaths

![Opioid- and Stimulant-related Harms in Canada[^1]](./static/opioid_stimulants_dashboard.png)

+ COVID-19 and the opioid crisis have demonstrated the importance and impact of local policies and prevention efforts on health outcomes
+ There is an existing gap in terms of regionally-specific, timely information related to opioid use and events. These are needed to help policy-makers and health care providers to plan
+ Statistics Canada and other federal government agencies have experiences modelling health outcomes, but generally only at the national or provincial level

We are developing an open-source modelling tool aimed towards projecting the impact of opioid use policies and interventions at the public health unit level in Canada.

# Methods

We are developing a compartmental agent-based risk model which will simulate the frequency and outcomes of opioid use in a synthetic population. With this approach, we aim to achieve the following:

 + Simulate counterfactual scenarios of policies and interventions
 + Asses impacts of these scenarios on a synthetic population
 + Produce outputs at lower-level geographies, e.g., the public health unit
 + Support policy makers and researchers with an easy-to-use tool
 + Adapt an open-science approach, e.g., make the tool publically available and free to use

# The Model

The model simulates opioid use and outcomes over a number of days, weeks or months for a synthetic population representative of a public health unit. The synthetic population is derived from the following:

+ Statistics Canada data, including local population characteristics
+ Population profile is represented as a set of probability distributions
+ Indidividual characteristics, e.g.,  socio-demographic, socio-economic, geographic, and health conditions

# Opioid Use State

These states compartmentalize the ways in which a model individual may use opioids. Directed arrows represent possible transitions between use states, with transition rates dependant on any of the following:

+ An individual's personal characteristics
+ Location of opioid use
+ Events that have occured for the individual or in the world
+ Interventions or policies that have been applied to the simulation
+ Transition multipliers specific to the health care system of the public health unit

These states include the location in which the agent is currently using opioids:

+ Housing status
+ Hospital
+ Prison
+ Safe site
+ Other

Certain events may have an impact on opioid-related outcomes, on a personal or global level:

+ Supply contamination
+ Injuries
+ Social assistance cheques
+ Overdoses

# Scenario Development

A key feature of a modeling approach is the ability to simulate counter-factual ('what-if') scenarios. For example:

+ What if there are more take-home naloxone kits available in the community?
+ What if there was an increased number of supervised safe consumption sites?

Our model can be adapted to include a number of policies or interventions related to opioid use and outcomes in order to explore different scenarios and their impact on the community. The model includes the following:

:::{.callout-note title="Take-home naloxone kit availability"}

Determines the number of naloxone kits available to take home at each moment in time.
:::

:::{.callout-note title="Opioid prescription alteration"}

Affects the rate at which opioid prescriptions are administered
:::

:::{.callout-note title="OAT prescription alteration"}

Affects the rate at which Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) is prescribed.
:::

:::{.callout-note title="Point-of-contact interventions"}

This intervention represents a broad class of interventions which may occur when an opioid-using actor comes into contact with the public health system. For example, visits to the hospital, emergency room/department, prison, or supervised safe consumption sites.

# Implementation

The implementation of the model will follow an open-science approach for research and dissemination:

+ Written completely in Python
+ Accompanied by Dash/Plotly user interface
+ Pre-packaged datasets tailored for public use
